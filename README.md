# 🎨 ArtCircle: Your AI-Powered Path to Art World Success

*Transform Jerry Saltz’s Rule #22 into your competitive edge*

---

## The Hard Truth About Artistic Careers

Talent alone isn’t enough. Most artists struggle not because of a lack of vision, but because they fail to build and maintain the twelve essential relationships that define a sustainable art career.

Pulitzer Prize-winning art critic Jerry Saltz said it best: *“You only need twelve people.”* ArtCircle takes that truth and turns it into a powerful system that helps you cultivate, grow, and manage your twelve most essential allies—dealers, curators, collectors, and critics.

---

## What ArtCircle Does (That No Spreadsheet Can)

Artists are asked to be everything: creator, marketer, networker, administrator. But no one teaches how to systematically nurture the right people.

ArtCircle replaces chaos with clarity. It's not a CRM. It's your AI-powered relationship architect—built specifically for artists.
